# CPSC 411A - Homework 2 - GeoQuiz App

For this homework, you will complete the *GeoQuiz App* as described all the way through from Chapter 1 to Chapter 2 of our textbook (excluding extra "challenges"). Read the following steps carefully and assume any generic steps (e.g., testament or git) will be assumed in all future assignments.

After you clone this repository to a local folder, start a new application in Android Studio and save it in the same folder. Confirm this by performing git commit and push commands, then checking that your Android Studio project successfully transported to your Github repo in our Github Organization.

Work your way through the steps in the textbook, performing git commits and pushes whenever you make significant progress.

When you're finished, locate the *Testament* file in this repo. Fill out all the information requested, then commit+push the completed version of the *Testament* file into your repo. It will be a critical part of your submission, so confirm it also shows up in your remote Github repo. The easiest way to do this is print out a copy of the PDF, write on it (writing must be ***very clear***), scan it, then save the scan in your repo as a multi-page PDF. You may also try exporting the PDF to a series of images, which you can then modify using an image editor, before converting the images back to a PDF.

Finally, confirm 100% of your work and testament actually made it to Github by performing a fresh clone of your repository to a new folder, and verifying it will build and run your application as intended with no further modifications.

Use our class chatroom for basic questions about homeworks. If the room is stumped for at least a day, feel free to email your professor with specific questions. Make sure any emails about homework include a high level of detail: What you're working on, where exactly you're stuck, what exactly you're doing, what exactly is wrong, etc. Use screenshots as well.
